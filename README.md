- Use kebab case naming convention for each repo directory name. For example, if your course section one is titled 'Getting Started' then use 's1-getting-started-slides', 's1-getting-started-scripts' and so on. Use this naming convention in both private and public repositories of your course. 
- For your course public repository, convert your slides to PDF format before pushing them. Use kebab case naming convention. Before converting slides to PDF make sure to remove or rearrange the overlapping elements from your slides. 
- Don't forget to delete all **placeholder** files and directories in your public course repository. Make it look clean and ready for viewers.
